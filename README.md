## Deploying MongoDB and Mongo-express in Kubernetes
This project demonstrates how to deploy MongoDB and Mongo-express in Kubernetes using YAML files.

### Getting started
#### Prerequisites
A Kubernetes cluster
kubectl command-line tool installed
Basic knowledge of Kubernetes concepts
Deploying MongoDB
To deploy MongoDB, run the following command:
kubectl apply -f mongodb-deployment.yaml
This will create a deployment for MongoDB in your Kubernetes cluster.

Next, create a secret YAML file to define the username and password for MongoDB:
"kubectl apply -f mongodb-secret.yaml"
This will create a Kubernetes secret that can be used to securely store sensitive information like passwords.

Finally, create an internal service to expose the MongoDB pod:
"kubectl apply -f mongodb-service.yaml"
This will create a Kubernetes service that targets the MongoDB deployment and makes it accessible to other pods in the cluster.

### Deploying Mongo-express
To deploy Mongo-express, run the following command:
"kubectl apply -f mongo-express-deployment.yaml"
This will create a deployment for Mongo-express in your Kubernetes cluster.

Next, create a ConfigMap resource to specify the MongoDB database URL:
"kubectl apply -f mongo-express-configmap.yaml"
This will create a Kubernetes ConfigMap that can be used to store configuration data.

Finally, create an external service with type LoadBalancer to expose the Mongo-express pod to the outside world:
"kubectl apply -f mongo-express-service.yaml"
This will create a Kubernetes service with type LoadBalancer that targets the Mongo-express deployment and makes it accessible externally on port 30000.
### Conclusion
This project demonstrated how to deploy MongoDB and Mongo-express in Kubernetes using YAML files. By following the steps outlined in this README file, you should be able to get your own MongoDB and Mongo-express deployments up and running in a Kubernetes cluster.
